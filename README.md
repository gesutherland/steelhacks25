## Inspiration
We were inspired by our own challenges with the healthcare system, particularly related to chronic illnesses and dynamic disabilities. Having so many providers across different hospitals often made it hard to get clear, up-to-date information, leaving us with more questions than answers. We come from different backgrounds major-wise, and it was really cool to combine our various interests to work on a problem that affected all of us in unique ways.

## What it does
Our project provides a useful medium and easy-to-use record software to streamline the communication and EHR process between patients and their care  providers. 

## How we built it
We started by designing our website in Figma, making sure to connect to each page, ensuring a smooth user experience. We then used SvelteKit to fill in the layout and connected it up with firebase to store our user data and add functionality. We used firebase for auth, storage, and its real-time database. Our choice to use SvelteKit and Firebase over other frameworks was to ensure our app was fast, reactive, and scalable. We finally used TailwindCSS to add styling and ensure quick development.

## Challenges we ran into
Two of the members of our group were completely new to both hackathons and the framework Svelte (along with Tailwind) which were the two major tools that were used in this project. Because of this, much time was spent learning the language rather than necessarily making the project. This made time management immensely difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that although 2 out of our 4 programmers were completely knew to hackathons and Svelte/TailwindCSS as well, they were able to learn quickly and build the project’s frontend efficiently as their skills got better over such a short period of time. We are also proud of our efforts to catch up on the lost time later on that was spent primarily on just learning. We are mostly proud of the features of our project like the UI (as it was designed by the new programmers) and the chat functionality that we implemented.

## What we learned
Two of the members of our group, Kosi and Colin, both did not know Svelte or TailwindCSS when starting this project. Colin did not even know HTML or CSS. Despite this, both worked hard to understand how to use these great tools for frontend development and were, in the end, incredibly successful in utilizing Svelte and Tailwind to design the frontend. Two of our teammates, Gabby and Colin also did not know how to use Figma, the design application we used, despite this they were successful in laying out a sleek frontend design with it. Finally, our teammate Ruadhan was able to learn and practice Firebase a lot more than he expected. We all took lessons from this project, especially those of us new to Hackathons.

## What's next for OurChart
We’d love to expand the system to include accessibility tools like smart summaries of doctor’s notes, language translation features, a more seamless way to import and export to various Electronic Health Recording systems (EHRs), video calling, and a chat system that allows multiple providers to speak with one patient at the same time, almost like a group chat. 

In the future, we’d love to partner with hospital systems or urgent care centers to bring OurChart to the broader community.
